# Experiment Overview

This experiment was conducted to investigate the development of spatial memory in 8- to 15-year-old children and adolescents. Participants navigated throughout a circular arena with a landmark and extra-maze, orientation cues created in Unity environment. Participants learned positions of 4 objects from which 2 were landmark-bound and 2 were boundary-bound. After block 1, landmark and landmark-dependent objects changed their position and participants had to notice an dlearn new positions.
